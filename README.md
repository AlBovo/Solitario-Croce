## Game
The game to be developed is the [Solitario a Croce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TJviLmuMg)

**How to play:** Five cards from the *deck* are placed in the center of the table to form a **cross**. Four positions, called *bases*, are left free.

The goal of the *solitaire game* is to build and complete the bases (from ace to king for each suit, in ascending order) by transferring all the cards to them. While the bases must follow the rule of the same suit in ascending order, the cross follows the rule of different suits in descending order.

The top card of each pile forming the cross can be moved to the bases, placed in an empty spot, or on top of another card in the cross. Only one card can be moved at a time. The card from the stock can go directly to the bases or be transferred to the table.

**Type of cards:** Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ cards (4 suits, 10 cards per suit).
